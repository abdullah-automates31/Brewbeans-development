# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Brew Beans is a static coffee shop website with a Supabase backend. There is no build step — open `index.html` directly in a browser or use a local server (`npx serve .` or VS Code Live Server). For accurate CSP behavior during development, use an HTTP server rather than `file://`. Deployment target is **Vercel** (security headers are configured in `vercel.json` at the repo root). The `_headers` file is a legacy Netlify artifact — keep `vercel.json` in sync with it if either changes.

## Architecture

| Page | JS | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | `js/main.js` | Customer-facing: menu (`menuItems` array), cart, ordering, geolocation |
| `order-tracking.html` | `js/order-tracking.js` | Order status polling (10 s) + browser notifications |
| `staff.html` | `js/staff.js` | PIN-protected staff dashboard, polls 15 s |
| `admin.html` | inline script | Supabase Auth email/password login page |
| `admin-dashboard.html` | `js/admin-dashboard.js` | Full admin UI (Supabase Auth session) |
| `privacy-policy.html`, `terms.html` | none | Static legal pages |

**Shared**: `js/supabase-config.js` (global `supabaseClient`) and `js/scroll-fx.js` (AOS init + scroll progress bar) on **all pages except `index.html`** (index skips `scroll-fx.js`; AOS is inited inside `main.js`).

**Script load order** (no bundler — order matters):
Bootstrap JS → jQuery 3.7.1 → AOS 2.3.4 → Supabase JS v2 → `supabase-config.js` → page-specific JS → [`scroll-fx.js`]

**Ignore the nested `Brew-Beans/` subdirectory** — it is an outdated backup copy of the project. Always edit files at the repo root.

## Key Patterns

**Menu data** lives in `js/main.js` as a hardcoded `menuItems` array (16 products with id, name, category, description, price, image). Changes to the menu require editing this array. The `menu-seed.sql` file can reseed the `menu_items` DB table if needed.

**Addon system** is entirely DB-driven (not hardcoded). Addon groups (`addon_groups`), options (`addons`), and their assignment to menu items (`menu_item_addon_groups`) are fetched live from Supabase. The `submit-order` Edge Function re-validates addon prices from the DB — client-side prices for addons are ignored.

**Cart state** is persisted in `localStorage` (`brewBeansCart` key) with sanitization on read. The cart object stores items keyed by product id.

**Critical writes go through Supabase Edge Functions** (TypeScript/Deno at `supabase/functions/*/index.ts`) for server-side validation. Read-only queries use RPCs.

| Layer | Functions | Location |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Edge Functions | `submit-order`, `update-order-status`, `create-payment` | `supabase/functions/*/index.ts` |
| RPCs (read/admin) | `get_order_status`, `staff_list_orders`, `get_business_hours` | Supabase DB only |

**Edge Functions** use the Supabase service-role key (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` env) to bypass RLS. Deploy with: `supabase functions deploy <name>`.

**Polling intervals**: staff dashboard polls every 15 s; order tracking polls every 10 s. Neither uses Supabase Realtime subscriptions.

**Delivery charge** is calculated client-side using the Haversine formula against hardcoded shop coordinates (`24.9180°N, 67.0971°E`). ETA is estimated as 15 min prep + 25 min delivery (or 8 min for pickup when delivery charge = 0). Geolocation permission is requested via a modal shown 3 s after page load.

**Staff authentication** is PIN-based, verified server-side via RPC, and the PIN is cached in `sessionStorage`. The page is served with `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`.

**Phone number privacy**: the customer's phone is stored in `sessionStorage` under the key `bb_phone_${orderNumber}` so it never appears in the browser history URL when returning from a payment gateway redirect.

**Order status flow**: `placed` → `preparing` → `out_for_delivery` → `delivered`. `cancelled` is reachable from any state. The `update-order-status` Edge Function enforces this enum; no other values are accepted.

## Browser Storage Keys

| Key | Storage | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `brewBeansCart` | localStorage | Cart items keyed by product id; sanitized on read |
| `brewBeansLastCustomer` | localStorage | Returning customer profile (name, phone, email, address, payment method, favorite items) |
| `brewBeansLastOrder` | localStorage | `{ orderNumber, phone }` for quick re-tracking |
| `brewBeansLocation` | localStorage | Cached `{ lat, lng }` from geolocation |
| `bbStaffPin` | sessionStorage | Cached staff PIN; cleared on logout |
| `bb_phone_${orderNumber}` | sessionStorage | Customer phone for tracking page; avoids exposing it in the URL |

## Supabase Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `menu_items` | Products (id, name, category, description, price, image, is_available, is_popular) |
| `addon_groups` | Addon groups (id, name, is_required) |
| `addons` | Addon options (id, group_id, name, price, is_available) |
| `menu_item_addon_groups` | Many-to-many join: menu items ↔ addon groups |
| `orders` | Order header (order_number, customer info, lat/lng, payment method/status, subtotal, delivery_charge, total, status) |
| `order_items` | Line items per order (menu_item_id, name snapshot, quantity, unit/total price) |
| `order_item_addons` | Addon selections per line item (addon_name, addon_price snapshots) |
| `staff_pins` | Staff PINs (name, pin 4–6 digits, is_active) |
| `business_hours` | Open/close times per day of week, is_closed flag |

## CSS

All styles are in `css/style.css`. Design tokens are CSS custom properties defined at `:root` (e.g., `--primary`, `--secondary`, `--text-*`). Bootstrap 5.3.2 handles the responsive grid; custom CSS overrides and extends it.

## Security Headers

`vercel.json` at the repo root configures response headers including a strict CSP that whitelists specific CDN origins and inline script hashes. **When adding new external scripts or inline `<script>` blocks**, update the CSP in `vercel.json` accordingly — otherwise they will be blocked in production. All user-generated content rendered into the DOM uses `escapeHtml()` or `innerText` assignment to prevent XSS.

## External Dependencies (CDN)

All loaded via CDN, no local `node_modules`:
- Bootstrap 5.3.2 + Bootstrap Icons 1.11.1
- jQuery 3.7.1
- AOS 2.3.4 (Animate On Scroll)
- Google Fonts: Poppins, Playfair Display
- Supabase JS client v2

## Payment Gateways

JazzCash and EasyPaisa are integrated via form redirects to their payment pages. The `create-payment` Edge Function builds the gateway form fields server-side. Both domains are whitelisted in the CSP `form-action` directive in `vercel.json`. The return URL lands on `order-tracking.html` with a `?payment=success|failed` query param.
